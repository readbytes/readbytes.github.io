    <!-- <h1 class ="chapter-title"></h1> -->
    <h2 id='what-is-java-io'>1.1 What is Java IO?</h2><p>Java IO (Input/Output) is a fundamental part of the Java programming language that enables programs to communicate with the outside world. Whether reading user input, writing data to a file, receiving data from a network, or processing binary streams, Java IO provides the tools and abstractions needed to perform these operations efficiently and reliably.</p><p>At its core, IO in Java is about <strong>data movement</strong>. The two main directions are:</p><ul>
 <li><strong>Input</strong> – receiving data from an external source (e.g., keyboard input, a file, or a network).</li>
 <li><strong>Output</strong> – sending data to an external destination (e.g., displaying text on the screen, writing to a file, or sending data over a socket).</li>
</ul><p>Without IO, Java programs would operate in isolation — like a person with no way to hear or speak. IO allows programs to be dynamic, interactive, and integrated with files, devices, and networks.</p><h3 id="purpose-of-java-io">Purpose of Java IO</h3><p>Java IO serves several key purposes:</p><ol>
 <li><p><strong>Data Communication</strong> Java IO enables reading from and writing to different sources like files, consoles, memory buffers, and network sockets. This is essential for real-world applications that interact with users or systems.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Persistence</strong> Programs often need to save information so that it can be retrieved later. Java IO allows this persistence by supporting file operations such as saving user settings, application logs, and serialized objects.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Interoperability</strong> Java IO helps bridge communication between systems. For example, reading and writing files in various formats allows Java programs to interact with data generated by other software systems.</p></li>
</ol><h3 id="real-world-analogy">Real-World Analogy</h3><p>To better understand IO, consider the analogy of a <strong>postal system</strong>:</p><ul>
 <li>You (the program) may want to <strong>read</strong> a letter sent to you (input).</li>
 <li>You may also want to <strong>write</strong> and send a letter to someone else (output).</li>
</ul><p>The <strong>IO system</strong> is the infrastructure that allows this to happen—envelopes (data streams), addresses (file paths or URLs), and mail carriers (stream objects) all play a part in making the communication successful.</p><p>Similarly, Java uses classes and interfaces like <code>InputStream</code>, <code>OutputStream</code>, <code>Reader</code>, and <code>Writer</code> to facilitate the transfer of data between programs and external sources or destinations.</p><h3 id="java-io-architecture-overview">Java IO Architecture Overview</h3><p>Java’s IO system is built around the concept of <strong>streams</strong>, which represent a continuous flow of data. This data can be in the form of <strong>bytes</strong> (binary data) or <strong>characters</strong> (text data). The stream abstraction allows developers to work with data without needing to know the exact source or destination—it could be a file, network socket, or memory buffer.</p><p>The core Java IO library is located in the <code>java.io</code> package and includes classes for:</p><ul>
 <li><strong>Byte streams</strong> (e.g., <code>InputStream</code>, <code>OutputStream</code>)</li>
 <li><strong>Character streams</strong> (e.g., <code>Reader</code>, <code>Writer</code>)</li>
 <li><strong>File handling</strong> (e.g., <code>File</code>, <code>FileReader</code>, <code>FileWriter</code>)</li>
 <li><strong>Buffered and data streams</strong> for optimized and structured IO</li>
 <li><strong>Object serialization</strong> for saving and restoring objects</li>
</ul><p>Later versions of Java introduced <strong>NIO (New IO)</strong> and <strong>AIO (Asynchronous IO)</strong> in the <code>java.nio</code> and <code>java.nio.channels</code> packages, which provide more efficient and scalable alternatives for high-performance applications.</p><h3 id="why-java-io-is-essential">Why Java IO is Essential</h3><p>Java IO is indispensable for a variety of programming tasks:</p><ul>
 <li><strong>Console-based applications</strong> rely on reading user input and displaying output.</li>
 <li><strong>Desktop applications</strong> read and write configuration files or load resources.</li>
 <li><strong>Web servers</strong> use IO to handle requests and send responses over the network.</li>
 <li><strong>Data-driven applications</strong> interact with logs, databases, and data files.</li>
 <li><strong>Cloud-based and distributed systems</strong> rely heavily on asynchronous and non-blocking IO to support massive concurrency.</li>
</ul><p>Mastering Java IO is not just about syntax—it's about understanding how data flows between systems and how to manage it efficiently and securely.</p><h3 id="types-of-io-operations-in-java">Types of IO Operations in Java</h3><p>Java supports several types of IO operations, each designed for specific needs:</p><ol>
 <li><p><strong>Byte-Oriented IO</strong> Operates at the byte level and is ideal for handling binary data such as images, audio files, or any non-text content. Classes include <code>InputStream</code>, <code>OutputStream</code>, and their subclasses.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Character-Oriented IO</strong> Designed for handling textual data using Unicode characters. It uses <code>Reader</code> and <code>Writer</code> classes to process text reliably, especially with international characters and encoding.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Buffered IO</strong> Adds a layer of buffering to IO operations, which enhances performance by reducing the number of interactions with the underlying source or destination. Classes like <code>BufferedReader</code> and <code>BufferedOutputStream</code> fall into this category.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Data Streams and Object Streams</strong> These allow reading and writing Java primitive types and objects in a portable, structured format. This includes classes like <code>DataInputStream</code>, <code>DataOutputStream</code>, <code>ObjectInputStream</code>, and <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>NIO (New IO)</strong> A scalable, non-blocking IO API introduced in Java 1.4 for high-performance applications. It introduces channels, buffers, and selectors.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>AIO (Asynchronous IO)</strong> Introduced in Java 7 (NIO.2), this allows asynchronous, callback-based IO processing for file and socket operations.</p></li>

<h2 id='history-and-evolution-of-java-io'>1.2 History and Evolution of Java IO</h2><p>The Java Input/Output (IO) system has evolved significantly since the language’s early days. What began as a relatively simple stream-based API in Java 1.0 has grown into a comprehensive and high-performance framework capable of supporting the demands of modern applications, including asynchronous IO, file watching, memory mapping, and scalable non-blocking networking.</p><h3 id="the-original-io-api-java-io">The Original IO API (java.io)</h3><p>The first version of Java, released in 1996, introduced the <code>java.io</code> package — a set of classes and interfaces designed around the concept of <strong>streams</strong>. Streams abstract data input and output as sequences of bytes or characters, making IO operations device-agnostic. The design was elegant in its simplicity:</p><ul>
 <li><strong>Byte streams</strong> (<code>InputStream</code>, <code>OutputStream</code>) handled binary data.</li>
 <li><strong>Character streams</strong> (<code>Reader</code>, <code>Writer</code>) were introduced to manage textual data with support for Unicode.</li>
</ul><p>Developers could wrap streams for buffering (<code>BufferedInputStream</code>), filtering (<code>FilterInputStream</code>), or for handling data primitives (<code>DataInputStream</code>, <code>DataOutputStream</code>). For object serialization, Java provided <code>ObjectInputStream</code> and <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>.</p><p>While effective for many use cases, this IO model had <strong>several limitations</strong>, particularly in applications that required high concurrency, performance tuning, or low-level control over data transfer.</p><h3 id="limitations-of-the-original-io-model">Limitations of the Original IO Model</h3><ol>
 <li><p><strong>Blocking IO</strong>: The original stream-based IO was blocking by design. When a thread performed a read or write operation, it would block (pause) until the operation was complete. In a server handling many clients, this meant a separate thread was needed for each connection — a scalability bottleneck.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Lack of Multiplexing</strong>: Java IO lacked the ability to monitor multiple data sources with a single thread. Other languages and systems (e.g., C with <code>select()</code> or <code>epoll</code>) already supported this.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Limited File and Socket Control</strong>: The original API offered minimal access to underlying system-level features like file locking, memory-mapped files, or direct buffer management.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>No Asynchronous IO</strong>: There was no built-in mechanism for non-blocking or asynchronous file or socket IO, limiting responsiveness in GUI or network-heavy applications.</p></li>
</ol><p>These shortcomings led to the introduction of a new architecture.</p><h3 id="the-birth-of-java-nio-new-io-java-1-4">The Birth of Java NIO (New IO) Java 1.4</h3><p>With the release of Java 1.4 in 2002, the <strong>java.nio</strong> (New IO) package was introduced. It was a major redesign focused on performance, scalability, and fine-grained control over IO operations. Java NIO was not a replacement but a supplement to the existing IO API.</p><p>Key innovations in Java NIO included:</p><ul>
 <li><p><strong>Channels</strong>: Unlike streams, channels support bi-directional data flow and are non-blocking. Examples include <code>FileChannel</code>, <code>SocketChannel</code>, and <code>DatagramChannel</code>.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Buffers</strong>: NIO introduced <code>ByteBuffer</code>, <code>CharBuffer</code>, and others as containers for data. Buffers enabled efficient read/write operations, and unlike streams, they gave the programmer control over how data was stored and accessed.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Selectors</strong>: Selectors allowed a single thread to monitor multiple channels for IO readiness (read, write, accept, connect), enabling scalable event-driven servers.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Memory-Mapped Files</strong>: Developers could map files directly into memory using <code>MappedByteBuffer</code>, providing ultra-fast file access and manipulation.</p></li>
</ul><p>Java NIO marked a turning point in IO programming by aligning Java with system-level capabilities offered by native OS APIs.</p><h3 id="enhancements-in-java-nio-2-java-7">Enhancements in Java NIO.2 Java 7</h3><p>Java 7 introduced <strong>NIO.2</strong>, an enhanced version of NIO that added several much-needed features:</p><ul>
 <li><p><strong>Asynchronous IO (AIO)</strong>: The <code>java.nio.channels</code> package was expanded to support asynchronous file and socket channels (<code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code>, <code>AsynchronousSocketChannel</code>) with <code>Future</code> and <code>CompletionHandler</code> support, allowing true non-blocking, callback-based IO.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Improved File Handling</strong>: The <code>java.nio.file</code> package introduced the powerful <code>Path</code>, <code>Files</code>, and <code>FileSystems</code> classes, replacing the older <code>File</code> class for most use cases. It also included symbolic link handling, directory walking, and file attribute APIs.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>WatchService API</strong>: NIO.2 included the ability to monitor file system changes like create, delete, and modify events — crucial for building reactive applications and file watchers.</p></li>
</ul><h3 id="recent-developments-and-beyond">Recent Developments and Beyond</h3><p>Since Java 8 and onwards, enhancements to IO and NIO have been more incremental but no less important:</p><ul>
 <li>Java 9 added improved support for reactive programming via the <code>Flow</code> API.</li>
 <li>Java 11 introduced additional file utility methods and enhanced character set support.</li>
 <li>Future releases, such as Java 21 and beyond, continue to refine IO with <strong>Project Loom</strong>, which introduces lightweight virtual threads—making traditional blocking IO more scalable by drastically reducing the cost of thread-per-connection models.</li>

<h2 id='overview-of-stream-based-io'>1.3 Overview of Stream-Based IO</h2><p>In Java, a <strong>stream</strong> is a sequence of data elements made available over time. Think of a stream as a channel or conduit through which data flows. It could represent a flow of bytes coming from a file, data being read from the keyboard, or characters being sent to a printer.</p><p>Streams in Java abstract the underlying source or destination of the data. This means that the same <code>InputStream</code> interface can be used to read data from a file, a socket, or even memory — the developer doesn’t have to worry about the underlying mechanics of the data source or sink.</p><p>Streams in Java come in two major categories:</p><ul>
 <li><strong>Input Streams</strong> – for reading data into a program.</li>
 <li><strong>Output Streams</strong> – for writing data out from a program.</li>
</ul><p>This model allows Java to provide a flexible, extensible, and consistent way of handling IO across different types of data sources and destinations.</p><h3 id="how-streams-abstract-io">How Streams Abstract IO</h3><p>The stream abstraction hides the complexity of IO operations and provides a simple programming model:</p><ul>
 <li>For <strong>input</strong>, data flows <strong>into</strong> the program from an external source.</li>
 <li>For <strong>output</strong>, data flows <strong>out</strong> of the program to an external destination.</li>
</ul><p>This model is <strong>linear</strong> — data is read or written sequentially, one element at a time (usually a byte or character). You don’t need to load entire files into memory or manually manage file pointers. Instead, the stream interface provides high-level methods such as <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, <code>close()</code>, and others.</p><p>This abstraction allows developers to work with different types of data streams using the same programming paradigm, whether reading a file from disk, a web response from a URL, or user input from the console.</p><h3 id="types-of-streams-in-java">Types of Streams in Java</h3><p>Java divides its stream classes into two main groups:</p><ol>
 <li><p><strong>Byte Streams</strong> (binary data)</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Classes: <code>InputStream</code> and <code>OutputStream</code> (abstract base classes)</li>
   <li>Used for: reading and writing raw bytes (e.g., images, audio, binary files)</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li><p><strong>Character Streams</strong> (text data)</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Classes: <code>Reader</code> and <code>Writer</code> (abstract base classes)</li>
   <li>Used for: reading and writing characters, with support for Unicode and encodings</li>

 <li><code>read()</code> – reads a byte or character from an input stream.</li>
 <li><code>write(int b)</code> – writes a byte or character to an output stream.</li>
 <li><code>close()</code> – closes the stream and releases system resources.</li>
 <li><code>flush()</code> – forces any buffered output to be written.</li>
</ul><h3 id="recap">Recap</h3><p>Stream-based IO in Java provides a simple and powerful way to work with data. Whether you're handling files, network sockets, or console input/output, the stream abstraction lets you focus on <strong>how</strong> data flows rather than <strong>where</strong> it comes from or goes.</p><p>Streams make IO operations consistent and composable across different sources and formats. By separating byte and character handling, Java also helps ensure correctness in processing both binary and textual data. As we move further into the Java IO ecosystem, you’ll see how these foundational concepts scale into more advanced topics like buffered IO, object serialization, and non-blocking channels.</p><div class = "chapter-navi-section">

<h2 id='blocking-vs-non-blocking-io'>1.4 Blocking vs Non-blocking IO</h2><p>When writing IO-based programs in Java, one of the most important design considerations is whether to use <strong>blocking</strong> or <strong>non-blocking</strong> IO. The distinction lies in <strong>how a thread behaves when it attempts to read or write data</strong> and whether it must wait for the operation to complete.</p><h3 id="blocking-io-traditional-and-simple">Blocking IO: Traditional and Simple</h3><h4 id="definition">Definition</h4><p><strong>Blocking IO</strong> refers to an IO model where the thread making a read or write call <strong>waits (blocks)</strong> until the operation completes. This model is straightforward and easy to implement, but it becomes inefficient when dealing with many concurrent IO tasks.</p><p>In Java, the classic IO streams (<code>InputStream</code>, <code>OutputStream</code>, <code>Reader</code>, <code>Writer</code>) follow the <strong>blocking IO model</strong>.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4><p>Imagine you're at a bank teller window (the thread), and you're waiting for a transaction to finish (the IO operation). You <strong>cannot leave</strong> until the teller is done — even if it takes a long time.</p><p>Here’s a simple blocking IO example:</p><div class="code-block"><button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">📋</button>
 <pre><code class="language-java">import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        System.out.print("Enter something: ");
        String input = reader.readLine(); // This blocks until the user presses Enter
        System.out.println("You entered: " + input);

    }
}</code></pre>
</div><p>In this case, the thread is blocked at <code>readLine()</code> until the user provides input.</p><h4 id="advantages-of-blocking-io">Advantages of Blocking IO</h4><ul>
 <li>Simple and intuitive to implement.</li>
 <li>Suitable for applications with limited and predictable concurrency (e.g., desktop apps, scripts).</li>
</ul><h4 id="drawbacks-of-blocking-io">Drawbacks of Blocking IO</h4><ul>
 <li><strong>Scalability limits</strong>: One thread per connection becomes expensive in terms of memory and context-switching.</li>
 <li><strong>Inefficiency under high load</strong>: Many threads may spend most of their time idle, waiting for IO.</li>
</ul><h3 id="non-blocking-io-scalable-and-efficient">Non-Blocking IO: Scalable and Efficient</h3><h4 id="definition">Definition</h4><p><strong>Non-blocking IO</strong> allows threads to <strong>initiate IO operations and continue doing other work</strong> while waiting for the operation to complete. Instead of waiting, the program is notified when the data is ready to be read or written.</p><p>In Java, this model is supported by the <strong>Java NIO (New IO)</strong> package, introduced in Java 1.4. NIO uses <code>SelectableChannel</code>, <code>Selector</code>, and <code>Buffer</code> classes to achieve non-blocking behavior.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4><p>Back to our bank analogy: with non-blocking IO, you fill out a request slip (register interest in IO), drop it in a box, and move on. The bank calls your number (via a selector) when your transaction is ready.</p><p>Here's a conceptual snippet using NIO:</p><div class="code-block"><button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)">📋</button>
 <pre><code class="language-java">import java.nio.channels.SelectionKey;
import java.nio.channels.Selector;
import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel;
import java.util.Set;

public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
        SocketChannel channel = SocketChannel.open();
        channel.configureBlocking(false);
        Selector selector = Selector.open();
        channel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);

        // Later in event loop
        selector.select(); // Blocks until at least one channel is ready
        Set&lt;SelectionKey&gt; readyKeys = selector.selectedKeys();
        for (SelectionKey key : readyKeys) {
            if (key.isReadable()) {
                // Data is ready to be read from the channel
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
</div><h4 id="advantages-of-non-blocking-io">Advantages of Non-Blocking IO</h4><ul>
 <li><strong>Highly scalable</strong>: One thread can handle thousands of connections.</li>
 <li><strong>Efficient resource usage</strong>: Threads aren’t blocked waiting on IO.</li>

<h2 id='synchronous-vs-asynchronous-io'>1.5 Synchronous vs Asynchronous IO</h2><p>In Java, how a program handles input and output (IO) operations has a profound impact on its performance and responsiveness. Two major models exist: <strong>synchronous IO</strong> and <strong>asynchronous IO</strong>. Both are essential in different scenarios and serve as the backbone of modern file and network communication.</p><h3 id="what-is-synchronous-io">What Is Synchronous IO?</h3><p><strong>Synchronous IO</strong> means that a thread initiates an IO operation and then <strong>waits until the operation completes</strong> before continuing. This model follows a <strong>step-by-step, blocking execution flow</strong>, making it predictable and easy to understand.</p><h4 id="execution-flow">Execution Flow</h4><ul>
 <li>The program executes one instruction at a time.</li>
 <li>When a read/write operation is triggered, the thread <strong>blocks</strong> until it finishes.</li>
 <li>Afterward, the next instruction is executed.</li>
</ul><p>This behavior is analogous to standing in line at a coffee shop: you place your order, wait until it’s ready, then proceed.</p><h4 id="java-apis-for-synchronous-io">Java APIs for Synchronous IO</h4><p>Most of Java’s classic IO classes use synchronous behavior. Examples include:</p><ul>
 <li><code>FileInputStream</code> / <code>FileOutputStream</code></li>
